A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

The idea of the project is a platform that combines the supplier, the marketer, and the shopper in the same place

So the benefit that each of these users will get is :
* Supplier / Through our platform he/she can get many marketers for his products with a marketing percentage, he determines it for each category of his products, whether they are few or many

* Marketer /The marketer can get a supplier where he markets his products and gets the marketing percentage. As a result, the marketer does not take the trouble of buying products or even looking for warehouses to store them!!!. He can sell the products through our platform, by marketing them only.

* Shopper /The shopper through our platform can get many products through many marketers, as he can get the product he wants at different prices and offers, and every marketer offers discount coupons, which is excellent!!!
